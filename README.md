* Description
A classic memory game where the player is presented with a grid of cards.
The player must remeber what cards did he pick otherwise game will restart. The game is won when player picked all six cards.

* How to play
1. Click on a card and remeber it.
2. Order of cards will change so you need to pick a card that you didn't choose previously.
3. When you get all six of them you win.

* Note 
I used this project to learn and practice react hooks and I also choose to use vite insted of create-react-app or webpack.
