* DESCRIPTION

  A classic memory game where the player is presented with a grid of cards.
  The player must remeber what cards did he pick otherwise game will restart. The game is won when player picked all six cards.

* HOW TO PLAY

  - Click on a card and remeber it.
  - Order of cards will change so you need to pick a card that you didn't choose previously.
  - When you get all six of them you win.

* NOTE

  I used this project to learn and practice react hooks and I also choose to use vite insted of create-react-app or webpack.
